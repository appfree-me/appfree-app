### About Appfree
 ☎️ **A framework to provide smartphone-only services to the smartphone-less masses** ☎️

- [ ] Kürzen  und auf die Technik eingehen!
Appfree is a framework allowing you to easily create Interactive Voice Response apps, e. g. apps which can be interacted with from a normal telephone or featurephone. It is based on a modern tech stack: PHP 8 and Laravel.

Are you feeling anxious when you notice you forgot your smartphone?
Are you feeling frustrated having to constantly update apps or having to reenter a password at the worst possible moment?

More and more things in daily life depend upon you having constant access to a charged, working smartphone with high speed data allowance.

Appfree is a project designed to relieve these feelings of frustration and anxiety and to deliver empowerment to everyday citizens.

Using appfree, you as a developer can create simple frontends for app only services which are normally usable only via a classic telephone or dumbphone.

The framework comes with a fully functional sample application for the city of Munich bike sharing service "MVG Rad", which is normally usable only via an Android/iOS app.  
With appfree, it is usable from every telephone.
